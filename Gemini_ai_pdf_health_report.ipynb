However, this alone doesn't confirm typhoid.  Further investigation and clinical evaluation are necessary as a positive Widal test can be caused by past infection or cross-reactivity with other organisms. *Salmonella Paratyphi* AH and BH titers were within the normal range.\n",

            "* **Slightly Low Serum Sodium:** Serum sodium was slightly below the lower limit of the reference range (122 mmol/l vs 135-146 mmol/l).  This warrants further investigation and correlation with the patient's clinical picture.  Serum potassium and chloride were within normal ranges.\n",
